Centipede
=========

Language : [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

This is a basic iOS game written in Swift and based off the old arcade game called [Centipede](http://my.ign.com/atari/centipede) by Atari. 

I could not have done this without the great help of Ray Wenderlich and his [Swift Tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials).
